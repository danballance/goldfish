- Ask me questions if you have any doubt or uncertainty about an aspect of a task.
- Keep the code as simple and concise as possible.
- Be sure to cover all code with unit tests.
- Because I am new to the Go language, please provide lots of comments to explain all of the code.
- Solve bugs by writing a failing unit test that demonstrates the bug and making the test pass, rather than guessing, changing code and re-running. Remember to be a senior engineer and not a junior ;-)
